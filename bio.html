                <!-- About -->
                    <p><b>I am deeply passionate about learning and strive for personal and professional growth.</b><br>
                        My mindset is rooted in the belief that there is always room for improvement, almost to a fault,<br>
                        as I am never truly satisfied with where I am in life or my pursuits.</p>
                        
                    <p>
                        <b><i>Mindfulness and yoga</i></b> are integral parts of my life, as they allow me to cultivate a deeper<br>
                        understanding of myself and the world around me. Exploring the intricacies of the human body and its<br>
                        functions, particularly the art of breathing, fascinates me. I am captivated by the profound mind-body<br>
                        connection and how it influences our overall well-being. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Being surrounded by individuals who share a <b><i>growth mindset</i></b> is very important to me.<br>
                        I thrive in environments where communication and human connection are valued, as they provide<br>
                        opportunities for collaboration, inspiration, and collective growth. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Driven by my passion for learning, mindfulness, and the mind-body connection, <br>
                        I am dedicated to embarking on a continuous journey of self-discovery and personal <br>
                        development. It is through this pursuit that <br>
                        <b><i>I seek to make a positive impact on both myself and the world around me.</i></b> 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>I have experience in <b>HTML, CSS, 
                    JavaScript, Python, PHP, MySQL,</b> <br>
                    and various other technologies that 
                    make up the web development ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>With over a decade of experience in the service industry, I've had the 
                    opportunity to work in different roles, <br>
                    from managing cafes, working in a pharmacy, to assisting in estate sales. 
                    <br>These experiences have honed my skills in <b>team management</b>, <b>customer service</b>, and 
                    <b>project coordination</b>. <br>
                    I love teaching and sharing my knowledge with others, and <br>
                    I find fulfillment in guiding and empowering individuals to reach their full potential.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond the world of web development and service, I am a <b>certified yoga 
                    instructor</b> and <b>breath coach</b>.<br>
                     Exploring the mind-body connection has become a 
                    personal passion of mine. I'm captivated by human behavior, psychology, <br>
                    and the fascinating field of epigenetics. 
                    I'm constantly seeking ways to incorporate mindfulness <br>
                    and the latest findings in neuroscience into my daily life and work.</p>
                    
                    <p>My curiosity led me to the captivating realm of machine learning and 
                    artificial intelligence. I'm eager to delve into neural networks <br>
                    and apply my expertise in Python to this exciting field. Python has become one of my preferred <br>
                    languages due to its vast possibilities and versatility. <br>
                    The potential it holds for pushing boundaries and solving complex problems is truly inspiring.</p>
                    
                    <p>I studied at The Ohio State University, where I developed a 
                    foundation in computer science. To further enhance my skills and stay up to 
                    date with the <br>
                    latest industry practices, I am currently enrolled in a Software 
                    Engineering bootcamp taught by Colt Steele. This intensive program <br>
                    allows me to deepen my knowledge and refine my craft.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am thrilled to embark on new ventures, collaborate with like-minded 
                    professionals, and contribute to groundbreaking projects in the realm of 
                    machine learning and AI. <br>
